                        <p class="text-left font-weight-bold text-muted bg-light rounded-lg">Instead of replicating
                          the Weatherpy solution that Trilogy promotes for this homework assignment, I decided to show
                          the comparison between their solution to the problem and my solution to the problem. I will
                          demonstrate my understanding of the required web skills at the same time. This may make it
                          more challenging for the grader, but hopefully the content will be worth the effort.
                          First, the databases. One of the main goals of the Weatherpy assignment is to use an
                          established API. The API, ‘api.openweathermap.org’ is the one selected for the Weatherpy
                          assignment. OpenWeather is a commercial weather data management company that provides access
                          to weather data of all sorts. The second source of data recommended to use is the ciyipy
                          library, that has a github pip install. This was selected because it has a function which
                          finds the nearest city in its database (Maxmind):
                          www.maxmind.com/en/free-world-cities-database) to a geographical coordinate.
                          The weatherpy homework suggest randomizing lats and longs and then using those lats and
                          longs to feed the citypy function to return a city name, which we would then use to find a
                          city in the openweathermap API to retrieve the weather data. There are all kinds of issues
                          with this approach to getting the weather data. First, the list of cities in citipy are not
                          coherent with the list of cities in openweather. There are spelling differences, for
                          example, and two entirely different lists. Second, the provided lat-long randomizer
                          randomizes the wrong thing, and then uses the wrong process. The idea of using citipy to
                          find the nearest city from a lat and long is great if I am looking for the nearest
                          restaurant. Using it to find the nearest city so we can ascertain measurements for our lat
                          and long is just wrong. If we had extremely fine granularity in our measurement system, such
                          exists in a city itself, this would be just fine, but we are talking about the world.
                          Seventy percent of the world is covered by water which means that 70% of the world has no
                          measurement stations in openweatherorg. What happens with Trilogy’s solution is that 70% of
                          our randomly selected points are in the oceans of the world, and the nearest cities are all
                          coastal cities, not to mention that the nearest city to a point in the ocean could be
                          thousands of miles north or south.
                          A better approach to this problem is the one I did in the weatherpy homework, and I will
                          demonstrate the differences in this web assignment. First, I recognized that a coherent
                          database of cities for the openweathermap API is provided in their bulk data. They maintain
                          a list of all the weather stations, approximately 23000, that are queried every few minutes.
                          I downloaded this database and use it to randomly select the cities using the
                          ‘df.sample(number)’ function provided by Pandas. Now, I have a list of measurements that are
                          consistent with their actual location on Earth. I also have a coherent list of cities with a
                          99.2% find rate, so my efficiency improves greatly. I think the citipi has about 1600 cities
                          and find rate was atrocious.
